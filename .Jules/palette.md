## 2025-10-21 - Dynamic AssistChip Accessibility
**Learning:** AssistChips used for quick actions (e.g., "+1") are ambiguous to screen readers. They need dynamic content descriptions combining action and item name (e.g., "Add 1 minute to Meditation").
**Action:** Always wrap AssistChips in semantics modifiers with explicit, descriptive contentDescription when the visible label is terse.
