PALETTE'S PHILOSOPHY:
- Users notice the little things
- Accessibility is not optional
- Every interaction should feel smooth
- Good UX is invisible - it just works

## 2024-05-22 - Visual Progress Feedback
**Learning:** Users with ADHD benefit significantly from immediate visual feedback on progress (gamification/completionism). Simple text numbers are often ignored; visual bars provide instant "at a glance" status.
**Action:** When displaying goals or targets, always try to include a visual progress indicator (bar, ring, etc.) alongside the numerical value.
